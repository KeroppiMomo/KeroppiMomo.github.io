        <h1>Moses Mok 莫晉曦</h1>

        <p>Hello! Here are some things I've done.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://keroppimomo.github.io/tripos-notes/"><b>Tripos notes</b></a> (Mar 2024 &ndash; present).
                I study mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
                These are notes I made for revision and quick reference,
                and I publish them in the hope that someone would find them useful.</p>

                <p>Since my original notes are written in Markdown,
                I also wrote some Python code to convert them to HTML webpages.
                You can find it on the <a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/tripos-notes">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/calsimtor"><b>Calsimtor</b></a> (May 2023 &ndash; Jul 2023).
                This was my attempt to reverse engineer the programming language of the CASIO fx-50FH II calculator, which is commonly used by Hong Kong school students.</p>

                <p>I developed a lexer to represent calculator programs with plain ASCII code
                and a simulator to evaluate mathematical expressions in COMP mode.
                However I have not completely worked out the program interpreter.
                I also documented intriguing behaviours of the calculator <a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/calsimtor/blob/main/DOC.md">in the repo</a>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/mathboard"><b>Mathboard</b></a> (Mar 2022 &ndash; Jul 2022).
                From my personal experience of writing mathematics on digital tablets,
                I find it annoying to adjust symbols' positions manually in order to modify mathematical expressions.
                Therefore I built this prototype to demonstrate using mathematics handwriting recognition to create a non-obstructive digital notetaking experience.</p>

                <p>Taking advantage of the <a href="https://developer.myscript.com/">MyScript iink SDK</a>,
                this web-based application is able to recognise semantic structures in handwriting,
                which then allows it to tidy up symbols' positions after the user deletes existing handwriting.
                This creates a seamless experience in editing handwritten mathematics with minimal manual adjustments.
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/crappy-among-us"><b>Crappy Among Us</b></a> (Jan 2021 &ndash; Mar 2021).
                To take a glimpse of multiplayer game development,
                I made a bad knock-off of the multiplayer game <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/">Among Us</a>.</p>

                <p>The game makes use of <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> for front-end rendering and WebSocket for client-server communication.
                Although the game is unfinished, I had rewarding experience in designing a UI framework.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/MyTouchBar"><b>MyTouchBar</b></a> (May 2020 &ndash; Jan 2021).
                To fully customise the Touch Bar on my MacBook Pro,
                I took inspiration from <a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR">MTMR</a>
                and built this MacOS application as a personal project.
                Features include swipe gestures, Zoom meeting control, and weather information from the Hong Kong Observatory API.

            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/Schooler"><b>Schooler</b></a> (Mar 2020 &ndash; Dec 2020).
                It is an iOS and Android app aimed to help school students easily manage their calendar, timetable, assignments and reminders.</p>
                
                <p>The main challenge of this project was that the app was written primarily in Flutter, a cross-platform framework,
                but there were quite some platform-specific code in Swift and Kotlin to support background code execution and geofencing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/KeroppiMomo/MoSticker"><b>MoSticker</b></a> (Nov 2018 &ndash; Feb 2019).
                This is an iOS app to create, manage and share WhatsApp stickers.
                Users can use built-in tools to process images and export them to WhatsApp as sticker packs.
                They also have an option to log in and publish their sticker packs for others to download.</p>
